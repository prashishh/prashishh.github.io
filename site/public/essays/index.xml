      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would say these words this early in my life. The US was my home far away from home for the last four and a half years. I have made a lot of close friends here, and I cherish every moment with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I met some of the smartest, passionate, loving &amp;amp; caring people in this country. The US taught me about friendship, life, work, and passion in a whole new level. There were many life-changing events in the last few years, which helped me grow as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
