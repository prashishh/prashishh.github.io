I'm inspired by software. I like to read non-fiction books especially autobiographies, world history & economy.

I currently live in Kathmandu, Nepal and work at [Insight Workshop](https://insightworkshop.io/) & Yeti. Mostly interested in accelerating the development (through software/technology) in emerging markets.

Over the years, I have lived in India, Ohio, California and have been part of several organizations including [Clip](https://clip.mx/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://reps.mozilla.org/) & [Code for Nepal](http://codefornepal.org).
