I'm inspired by software. I like to build products & read books especially technology, spirituality, autobiographies, world history & economy.

I currently live in Kathmandu, Nepal and work in the intersection of digital ownership 

Over the years, I have lived in India (Allahabad) and the United States (Ohio & California) and am/have been part of several organizations including [Venture 23](https://www.venture23.io/), [iBriz AI](https://ibriz.ai/), [Innovate Tech](https://www.innovatetech.io/) & [Advanced Pedagogy](https://www.advancedpedagogy.com/), [Oyster Financials](https://oyster.io/), [Insight Workshop](https://insightworkshop.io/), [Clip](https://clip.mx/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://reps.mozilla.org/) & [Code for Nepal](http://codefornepal.org).
