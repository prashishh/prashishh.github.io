I started reading voraciously only in my late 20s. The book that kickstarted my reading habit was _Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari_ - which was kind of random, but I’m glad I picked that particular book. Since then, I’ve maintained my own collection of physical books as I prefer them over digital/audio copies. Below is a list of all the physical books that I own.

I usually pick up books through others’ (friends/virtual mentors/authors) lists or when strolling inside a local bookstore. I started noting down the year I read the book only from 2017. There are few books that I’ve read in the past, and since I don’t remember the year, I’ll just put them in the Bookshelf section. That section also holds the list of books that I haven’t started or completed.

I’ve marked books that I enjoyed reading in <span class="bookshelf-book-green">green</span> and those that I highly recommend reading in <span class="bookshelf-book-red">red</span>. If you like to suggest a book, please drop me [a message](mailto:namaste@prashish.xyz).
