## Overview

This article lays out a pragmatic architecture for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into existing database-centric systems with minimal disruption. It focuses on production-ready patterns that teams can adopt incrementally.

- Why: augment existing workflows, not replace them
- Where: read paths, write paths, search/retrieval, analytics, automation
- How: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), function calling, agents for ops tasks

## Reference Architecture

1. Data plane
   - OLTP/OLAP sources: Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery
   - Event streams: Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub
   - Object store: S3/GCS/Azure Blob for snapshots and embeddings
2. Vector and cache layer
   - Vector DB: pgvector, Weaviate, Qdrant, or OpenSearch
   - Cache: Redis for prompts, results, and feature flags
3. Orchestration
   - API gateway + service mesh
   - Workers for embedding, chunking, syncing, and scheduled refresh
4. LLM layer
   - Provider abstraction (OpenAI/Anthropic/Local)
   - Policy guardrails, redaction, prompt templates
5. Observability
   - Tracing, metrics, cost tracking, eval datasets

## Core Patterns

- Change Data Capture (CDC) → Embedding sync (near real-time)
- RAG over relational: SQL → chunk → embed → store → retrieve → synthesize
- Function-calling for safe writes and controlled side effects
- Toolformer/Agent-lite for ops: migrations, data quality checks, incident notes

## Migration Strategy (Phased)

- Phase 0: Shadow mode with read-only assistants (no writes)
- Phase 1: Human-in-the-loop suggestions (PRs, drafts, SQL review)
- Phase 2: Narrow-scope automation with hard guardrails
- Phase 3: Cost-aware continuous improvement and auto-eval

## Security and Governance

- PII redaction at the prompt boundary
- Row/column-level security preserved in retrieval
- Prompt signing, input/output validation, and rate limiting

## Example Use Cases

- Natural language → SQL assistant with lineage-aware fixes
- Contextual customer support pulling from CRM and tickets
- Data quality anomaly explainer and remediation drafts

## Next Steps

In the next parts of this series, we will publish:
- A reference implementation using Postgres + pgvector + Kafka
- Prompt kits and function-calling contracts for safe updates
- An observability playbook with cost and quality gates
