The web is a global participative platform where everyone can have their own voice and opinion. Despite the presence of such a huge source of knowledge in the web, people are still confused about possibilities of the web.

People know Firefox as the browser with a blue globe and an orange fox around it.

But, we are more than a browser.

We are a global community of passionate volunteers and contributors whose mission is to serve the user above all, advance the state of the web and keep it open.

People need to know this.



People need understand the web better so that they can take control their online lives.
