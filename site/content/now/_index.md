## **Get back to shape:**

I joined the gym after a very long break. The pause had added a mental blockade whenever I think of exercising or running. I've committed to go to the gym at least four times/week for the next three months. Waking up early has been tough!

I'm also helping one of [my close friend](https://www.instagram.com/momentum.shift/) build a fitness app. \[more on this in the coming months]
