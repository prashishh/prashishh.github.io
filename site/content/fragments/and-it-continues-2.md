Our time is shorter, shorter than the time it takes to finish a coffee. When your focus is to simply wake up and go to work, 
# more 
then you get distracted and lose your trail. It is important to recognize that It is important to make life more meaningful, purposeful & creative. Another question that I constantly ask myself is: Does this make me happy? Does it fulfill me? If the answer isn‚Äôt Hell Yes, it is time to take concrete actions to get back to my happiness trail.

More or less:

My virtual mentors for writing are Tim Urban and Derek Sivers. These two incredible human beings have a completely different writing styles. Tim writes long articles narrating as the first person and every nooks and corner of the subject. Derek writes short, crisp and valuable life lessons. My favorites are this, this, this and this.

Inspired by them, I tried writing a couple of drafts for #abakgarne. But it turned out horrible and, most importantly, didn‚Äôt capture my intention nor thought. It felt forced, and I had to scratch my head to write them.

As I go through my journey, I want to make the process fun for me and for everyone. I constantly ask myself what this publication should represent. The short answer is that I still don‚Äôt know. But, I‚Äôm sure that we are going to find out.

I want to make the journey fun and enlightening. And if there is a way you want to be part of this, please say hi! I‚Äôm always looking to meet people to listen to their crazy ideas.

Fun things to do in Kathmandu:

Contribute in local events (Taken at Karkhana‚Äôs Momasaur Spring Camp)

Visit exhibitions (Taken at Teach for Nepal‚Äôs 5th Anniversary)

Hike for a scenic view of the valley.
