Digital ownership is what makes blockchain exciting for me. For the first time, you can actually hold something that does not vanish just because a company shuts down or pulls the plug on its servers.

In games, we never had that. I spent endless hours in FIFA, Age of Empires, DOTA, and I don’t really have anything to show for it now. When the next version came out or a server went offline, everything I built disappeared. Meanwhile, I still have a box of toys and cards from when I was younger. They are still there, still mine, carrying little pieces of memory. Digital worlds never gave us that sense of permanence, because they were never designed to. They always belonged to someone else.

NFTs were the first attempt to change this, but most of them felt incomplete. The assets were on-chain, but the real game still ran on servers controlled by someone else. You could own a token, but not the actual thing you cared about. Fully on-chain feels different. When the game, the assets, the history, even the rules are all written on the same rails, nobody can erase it or shut it down.

Right now, only a few games work this way and they look simple next to the games we play today. But that is how it always starts. The earliest text-based games looked small not because the ideas were small, but because the technology of that time only allowed words on a screen. And still, from that, came entire genres, sprawling 3D worlds, and eventually global communities. The same thing is happening now. Web3 infrastructure has grown so much in the last few years, scaling to handle far more complex systems. That is why fully on-chain games now feel possible in a way they never did before.

For me, the real importance of digital ownership is not about trading or speculation. It is about being able to keep something. To carry it with you, to pass it down if you want. Maybe one day it will not just be game items but our whole digital footprint, something we can choose to hold on to or delete ourselves, instead of leaving that power in someone else’s hands.

I cannot say when that day comes. But I know it is where we are heading, and that is enough reason to stay excited.
