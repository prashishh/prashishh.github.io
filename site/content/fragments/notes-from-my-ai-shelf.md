Over the last few months I have found myself surrounded by books, talks and podcasts on AI. I pick one up in the evenings, sometimes just to flip through a chapter, other times to get lost in the stories of how this technology came to be and might turn out to be.

_Age of AI_ and _Genesis_ explore the wider consequences of how this technology could shape our lives and societies. Books like _AI Valley_, _AI Rising_, and _Chip War_ bring a more geographical perspective, tracing how AI rose in different parts of the world and inside the companies that pushed it forward. Reading them feels almost like going through autobiographies of industries, and I enjoy that part a lot.

Then there are the ones that go under the hood. _AI Engineering_ and _3Blue1Brownâ€™s course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks_ make the mechanics less mysterious and more approachable. Balancing the broader context with the technical detail has been exciting.

On my desk right now:
- Age of AI
- Genesis
- AI Valley
- AI Rising
- Chip War
- Co-intelligence
- The Coming Wave
- AI SuperPowers
- AI Engineering
- A Brief History of Intelligence
- Nexus
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks course by 3Blue1Brown (Youtube)

What strikes me most is the parallel to the industrial revolution. Back then machines gave us muscle, multiplying human power by hundreds or thousands, and people must have thought it was sorcery. Today AI is adding intelligence. The next revolution may not be of steel or coal but of thought. And behind the scenes there is already a quiet war underway of nations, companies, and ideas to see who will shape this new age.
