I paid all my orders in cash because my previous debit card was not active. But most stores didn’t accept cards anyways. This has remained the same for a long time. I hardly noticed any store with a card reader, unlike the stores in California.

Things are changing though. The government is pushing for digital & cashless payment. And e-wallets are popping up everywhere. I even gave a crash course to my dad on e-wallets.

He asked the most genuine question — किन रख्ने तेस्मा पैसा? (Why should I add money to the wallet?).

To be honest, digital payment is still in its infancy in Nepal. [Less than one percent](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/news/e-wallets-heralding-a-paperless-economy-103) of mobile users have mobile wallets, and there is so much room to grow. The core experience from the banking systems was broken. To give you an example: NIBL freezes your account if you enter your password wrong, thrice. To reset your password, you must go to their main office and pay money.

**Ridiculous!**
