I think the best way to explore a city is by walking. No doubt about it.

Whenever I travel, whether it is for a conference, a meeting, or an event, I try to carve out some time just to walk. During Token 2049 in Singapore a few years back, where the schedule was packed with side events scattered across the city, I made it a point to walk from one to the other whenever I could. The city is small, and it is lovely to move through it on foot. It was not only about getting from point A to point B, but about slowing down after a long day and pausing for a moment.

I have done the same in other places too. I remember walking endlessly in Turkey, wandering through streets without any plan. In Dubai it is harder, but around Marina Bay I still try. These walks are never just about reaching somewhere.

Recently, I picked up a book called In Praise of Walking. I just wanted to learn, to see if someone had written about the benefits of walking. And of course, there are plenty. Walking feels so natural because it is. Nature gave us two legs, our default mode of transportation, and it is almost funny how often we forget that.

When I visited the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, they encouraged us to walk barefoot, to touch the earth, to be grounded. That simple act spoke to me. It reminded me that walking is more than physical exercise. It is connection. To nature, to the city, to ourselves.

Walking has so many gifts, but above all, it sparks joy. And if you work in tech or spend most of your day on screens, I encourage you to skip that taxi or scooter at least once and walk to a destination if it is less than an hour away. It is a simple way to let your senses reconnect with the world around you.
