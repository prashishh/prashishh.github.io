I usually pick up books through others’ (friends/virtual mentors/authors) lists or when strolling inside a local bookstore. I started noting down the year I read the book only from 2017. There are few books that I’ve read in the past, and since I don’t remember the year, I’ll just put them in the Bookshelf section. That section also holds the list of books that I haven’t started or completed.
