## 10,000 Books

Right now my private library holds a little over a thousand books, but I like to imagine it one day reaching ten thousand. Not because I will ever read them all, but because collecting books feels like collecting seeds of knowledge.

When someone visits for the first time, I often hand them a book from the shelf. Inside the first page I note when and where I bought it, so they know this book had its own little journey before reaching them.

The shelves are surrounded by a few quiet guardians of knowledge. Saraswati with her veena, Ganesh lying down reading, Manjushree cutting through ignorance, and a warm chubby Buddha lost in a book. Their presence makes the library feel alive. One day this collection will not be mine anymore. I hope it will find its way into schools, libraries, or simply to people who will enjoy them. The spirit behind this comes from karma yoga, to act without attachment, to let go, and to feel everything and everyone as part of yourself. Books are part of that flow. They come into my life, and sooner or later, they will move on to someone else’s.

## AI and Creative Workflow

In 2015, I came across Tim Urban’s fascinating post about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and ASI (Artificial Superintelligence). It was an interesting read, but it was not an "aha" moment for me at the time. My exposure to AI (or machine learning back then) was mostly through its use in engineering systems such as fraud detection, recommendation engines, and pattern recognition tools in our payment infrastructure. It felt more like solving backend challenges than experiencing anything magical.

That changed ten years later.

Few months ago, I fed the entire documentation of our strategy game into ChatGPT, explaining the mechanics, economy, characters, and battle logic. I expected a basic summary, but the AI understood it deeply, asked relevant questions, explored edge cases, and even suggested improvements.  It felt like I was brainstorming with an actual game designer. That was the moment it all clicked. That was the moment it all clicked. It felt crazy! It reminded me of my first time using Lyft, a ride-sharing app in Cincinnati, and showed a glimpse of how technology can fundamentally reshape the future.

Fast forward to today, the same AI can fetch data from the internet, simulate decision-making, reason, and brainstorm together. The pace of innovation is not linear. It is exponential. The momentum will only accelerate from here.

Here is how we are using AI across our creative workflow:
- Generate art and animations using Midjourney
- Produce high-quality voiceovers & sounds through ElevenLabs
- Code suggestions and debugging from Claude and Cursor
- Design and storytelling using ChatGPT and Claude
- Many more with NotebookLM, Flow!

Today, AI contributes approximately 10-15% of our codebase, and I fully expect it to exceed 50% by next year. These tools are already handling many of the tasks that used to take up our developers', editors', and artists' time. The models keep getting better, and I can see them becoming even more powerful very soon. I can already envision an AI project manager that ties everything together, managing story, code, visuals, and audio, and coordinating the production process.

This journey with AI is just beginning. I would love to hear how others in the Kathmandu community are using AI in their own projects. I would be excited to meet, share, and learn from one another. These are my stories, and I look forward to hearing yours.

## Back to Writing, Thanks to AI

The progress of AI keeps surprising me, even when I expect it to work. This blog was built in 2018 when I was experimenting with Jekyll and Hugo late at night, mostly to see if I could get something working.

Since then I tried several times to bring it back, but the system (dependencies) was outdated and would not compile. I got busy, left it aside, and never returned to it. Every now and then I thought about fixing it. Even when a colleague helped, we could not get it running.

Yesterday I finally decided to give it another try, this time with a bit more confidence that AI could handle it. Using GPT-5 inside Cursor, the blog was up and running in less than fifteen minutes. Webpack, Node, Netlify were updated and templates were all fixed.

After that I spent some time making small changes to styles, updating the template, adding new content and adjusting a bit of code. The bookshelf section was also outdated, but I had a CSV with all the books in my personal library. I uploaded it, asked GPT-5 to read it, and it wrote scripts that parsed the file and generated individual entries for every book.

Seeing my entire library appear instantly on the site was oddly satisfying. I had been holding onto that CSV for years thinking one day I would get around to it. Without AI it would have taken me a full day, maybe more.

What this shows me is that with enough context and clear instructions, AI does solve the problem. If the ask is vague, it struggles. But if you can describe the steps, the system can execute. If I had tried doing this myself, I know I would have wasted hours googling errors and maybe even given up again. Outsourcing it would have cost money and time. Instead, with Cursor and GPT-5, I could do it quickly and without frustration.

It makes me bullish about how software will be developed in the future. The way we build is going to look very different in the next five years, and it is important for developers to learn how to work with AI. These tools are about helping you execute and making your work more efficient.

## Driving Force

Every Mozillian that I have met are passionate about their work. There is no ‘I’ in the community. This sense of togetherness isn't common in today's selfish world. And to be part of this community makes me a proud Mozillian. I could have easily spent my 25-days break completing full seasons of TV series. Or, if I wanted to be productive.. work on a hobby project. Both of them sounded fun as per my liking. However, that’s not what Mozillians do. A Mozillian would spend their free time taking actions to build communities. A Mozillian would work to make the web free and open. A Mozillian would create a movement. That’s what I wanted to do too. I wanted to inspire thousands of Mozillians to push themselves in making them their dream, a reality. That’s the reason I set out on this incredible journey [to travel around the United States](https://twitter.com/mozdrive) to spread the love about Mozilla and the Open Web.

Because driving 13,000 miles in 25 days is not an easy task. The body and mind could take so much. It takes discipline and motivation throughout the journey. There were times when I questioned my decision and why I was doing there in the first place. There were times where I wanted to chicken out half-way through thinking people will forget about my commitments. However, when you are on a journey which carried such a powerful message, that itself becomes your driving force. When you truly believe in a cause, your physical body will somehow find a way to make it happen and keep you moving forward.

## Fat wallets

I paid all my orders in cash because my previous debit card was not active. But most stores didn’t accept cards anyways. This has remained the same for a long time. I hardly noticed any store with a card reader, unlike the stores in California.

Things are changing though. The government is pushing for digital & cashless payment. And e-wallets are popping up everywhere. I even gave a crash course to my dad on e-wallets.

He asked the most genuine question — किन रख्ने तेस्मा पैसा? (Why should I add money to the wallet?).

To be honest, digital payment is still in its infancy in Nepal. [Less than one percent](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/news/e-wallets-heralding-a-paperless-economy-103) of mobile users have mobile wallets, and there is so much room to grow. The core experience from the banking systems was broken. To give you an example: NIBL freezes your account if you enter your password wrong, thrice. To reset your password, you must go to their main office and pay money.

**Ridiculous!**

## Fully On-Chain

Digital ownership is what makes blockchain exciting for me. For the first time, you can actually hold something that does not vanish just because a company shuts down or pulls the plug on its servers.

In games, we never had that. I spent endless hours in FIFA, Age of Empires, DOTA, and I don’t really have anything to show for it now. When the next version came out or a server went offline, everything I built disappeared. Meanwhile, I still have a box of toys and cards from when I was younger. They are still there, still mine, carrying little pieces of memory. Digital worlds never gave us that sense of permanence, because they were never designed to. They always belonged to someone else.

NFTs were the first attempt to change this, but most of them felt incomplete. The assets were on-chain, but the real game still ran on servers controlled by someone else. You could own a token, but not the actual thing you cared about. Fully on-chain feels different. When the game, the assets, the history, even the rules are all written on the same rails, nobody can erase it or shut it down.

Right now, only a few games work this way and they look simple next to the games we play today. But that is how it always starts. The earliest text-based games looked small not because the ideas were small, but because the technology of that time only allowed words on a screen. And still, from that, came entire genres, sprawling 3D worlds, and eventually global communities. The same thing is happening now. Web3 infrastructure has grown so much in the last few years, scaling to handle far more complex systems. That is why fully on-chain games now feel possible in a way they never did before.

For me, the real importance of digital ownership is not about trading or speculation. It is about being able to keep something. To carry it with you, to pass it down if you want. Maybe one day it will not just be game items but our whole digital footprint, something we can choose to hold on to or delete ourselves, instead of leaving that power in someone else’s hands.

I cannot say when that day comes. But I know it is where we are heading, and that is enough reason to stay excited.

## Integrity

Handshake deals are the best kind of business deals. People come together, discuss their ideas and shake on it. No legal paperwork, just trust and the promise of work.

**_Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles._**

Having the right ingredients of integrity will set the foundation for handshake deals. Being honest to yourself & others is the key to building long-term partnerships, and to creating something valuable together. Because it is impossible to start a business with someone who doesn’t pass your [trust threshold](https://organizationalphysics.com/2016/06/21/how-full-is-your-trust-battery/). 

I’m a strong believer of handshake deals, and I’ve been lucky that most of my ventures have started and ended with just verbal agreements. Legal wasn't required as we trusted our words enough. 

If you want to create a great business, you must have a have a golden and a silver circle of people. They will, in fact, vouch for you with their circle, and that is how you build a network of trust to move forward quickly.

## Joy

“What sparks joy?” — Wow, such a simple but complicated question to think about.

The first sentence that mapped on my head when I thought about this was — “What makes me happy?” Yeps, what are the things that make me happy? Period. Move along.

But it cannot be this simple, right?

I used to think that there are certain things that would always make me happy (or spark joy), many small/big things that I always look forward to doing. Those activities that I could fall back to when I need to find happiness.

Reading. Cooking. Listening to Music. Talking to friends. Writing code. Community Building. These are things that I look forward to. These are the things that I thought sparked my inner self.

But, do they always spark joy?

Not really.

They make me happy at different moments, at different circumstances. Listening to music during my commute sparks joy — when I’m reading, it’s a distraction. Cooking sparks joy when I have a lot of free time — the rest of the time I’m making to fill my tummy. Coding sparks joy when I’m making something for a cause— the rest of the time, I’m forcefully learning to get better.

For me, an activity sparks joy at a moment and for a reason.

Sometimes when I feel down, I don’t like to do anything from my make-me-happy-list. But those were suppose to spark joy in me, right?

The idea of ‘new’ can spark joy.

You might feel that a weekend trip wouldn’t spark joy after you’ve made up your mind to spend your entire weekend on your bed watching Netflix. The experience might spark joy. You don’t know. The new can spark joy.

It is interesting that this is a life long process of exploring and finding things that sparks joy inside you, or truly things that make you.

‘Til then.

## Maya

Working in tech for the past decade, I've been thinking about this concept called _Maya_ and how it maps to what I see around me. The tech industry feels like _Maya_ in action. Not sure why this keeps bugging me. _This is Maya._

You start as a junior developer, excited about every new library, every framework, convinced you're building the future. Then you become senior, and you watch the next wave of juniors get excited about... the exact same things. Different names, same energy. React becomes Vue becomes Svelte becomes whatever's next. Microservices become serverless become edge computing. _This is Maya._

Here we are, chasing the next promotion, the next salary bump, the next equity package. But I've watched colleagues get everything they thought they wanted, move to better companies, get acquired, even IPO. And then what? They're still checking Slack at 11 PM, still stressed about deadlines, still looking for the next thing. It never ends. _This is Maya._

Tech hubs are particularly good at this illusion. Everyone's chasing the unicorn exit, the life-changing money. But I know people who made it, who have serious money, and they're... still working 70-hour weeks at their next startup. Still desiring more. We've built golden handcuffs and convinced ourselves they're freedom. We think we have free will, but try leaving without another offer lined up, try taking a real break, try saying no to the urgent project. _This is Maya._

What gets me is how we've basically made suffering scalable. Junior developer problems: imposter syndrome, learning curve stress. Senior problems: architectural decisions, team management, oncall rotations. Principal problems: strategy, politics, existential questions about what we're even building. VP problems: board pressures, quarterly targets, managing managers. Founder problems... honestly, I don't even know where to start with that level of stress. Investor relations, existential company survival, the weight of everyone's livelihood. It's like we've engineered a perfect misery ladder. More money, more problems at every level. Anyway. _This is Maya._

Even our solutions just feed the cycle. Burned out at your corporate job, everyone says switch to a startup for the energy and equity. Startup grinding you down, go independent, be your own boss. Still miserable, maybe try a bigger company for the stability and benefits. It's musical chairs but with careers. We keep switching companies, switching roles, thinking the next move will fix whatever's wrong. _This is Maya._

But the problem isn't the job, the company, or even the industry. It's the belief that any configuration of external circumstances can give us what we're actually looking for. We've convinced ourselves that if we just find the right role, the right team, the right compensation package, then we'll finally feel... I don't know, satisfied? The external stuff never works out the way we think. Because what we're actually looking for isn't in the org chart or the pay grade or whatever. It's something that no amount of reshuffling can touch. _This is Maya._

The companies change names, the technologies evolve, but the stage stays the same. New actors playing the same roles. Eventually our careers end, we retire or get laid off, and whether we shipped that killer feature or got that promotion, it all becomes someone else's legacy. That recognition, that seeing through the pattern? That's where the real work begins. _And this is Maya._

---
_The concept of Maya is too immense and deep to be captured in a short fragmented thought. There have been entire books and literatures devoted to understanding it. I've just tried to map it to what I see in the tech industry._

## Notes From My AI Shelf

Over the last few months I have found myself surrounded by books, talks and podcasts on AI. I pick one up in the evenings, sometimes just to flip through a chapter, other times to get lost in the stories of how this technology came to be and might turn out to be.

_Age of AI_ and _Genesis_ explore the wider consequences of how this technology could shape our lives and societies. Books like _AI Valley_, _AI Rising_, and _Chip War_ bring a more geographical perspective, tracing how AI rose in different parts of the world and inside the companies that pushed it forward. Reading them feels almost like going through autobiographies of industries, and I enjoy that part a lot.

Then there are the ones that go under the hood. _AI Engineering_ and _3Blue1Brown’s course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks_ make the mechanics less mysterious and more approachable. Balancing the broader context with the technical detail has been exciting.

On my desk right now:
- Age of AI
- Genesis
- AI Valley
- AI Rising
- Chip War
- Co-intelligence
- The Coming Wave
- AI Superpowers
- AI Engineering
- A Brief History of Intelligence
- Nexus
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks course by 3Blue1Brown (Youtube)

What strikes me most is the parallel to the industrial revolution. Back then machines gave us muscle, multiplying human power by hundreds or thousands, and people must have thought it was sorcery. Today AI is adding intelligence. The next revolution may not be of steel or coal but of thought. And behind the scenes there is already a quiet war underway of nations, companies, and ideas to see who will shape this new age.

## On Inspiration

People have asked me a countless number of times why I moved back. I have been pondering over this for some time. For the last few weeks, I have been looking for my “inspiration”.

We find inspiration in unknown places. Places which, by nature, engulf your existence and take you to a land of discovery. The discovery isn’t through the act of finding the meaning though, but by traveling through the journey. The journey might not have checkpoints nor cheerleaders, but characters who went through their paths to connect the dots going backward. Last few weeks, these characters have been my imaginary friends from **books on history and biography.**

As life takes you through your journey, you might get caught into its net. It is essential to pause and take a hard look at your goals, and where you want to be. I did that when I was in the US. My vision didn’t match my actions. I needed a hard reset, a break to reflect and rediscover myself.

Our time is shorter, shorter than the time it takes to finish a coffee. When your focus is to simply wake up and go to work, then you get distracted and lose your trail. It is important to recognize that. It is important to make life more meaningful, purposeful & creative.

Another question that I constantly ask myself is: _Does this make me happy?_ _Does it fulfill me?_ If the answer isn’t **Hell Yes**, it is time to take concrete actions to get back to _my happiness trail_.

## Same ‘ol Kathmandu

To be honest, Kathmandu hasn’t changed a lot. I see the same shops, the same restaurants, the same school buses, the same गल्लि (small roads) at the same spots where I left them five years ago. Things have remained the same for the better, or for the worse.

I was fortunate to meet a lot of people last week that I would have met in six months in California. My phone was ringing instead of buzzing, which says that people still prefer calling instead of texting in Nepal.

The sense of community, the bond of togetherness & richness of us is powerful here. You’ll find pockets of people watching projects happening in their locality. You’ll find them talking endlessly about people, politics, and the country. One person said to me that they have 45 households in their community, and everyone knows each other. I cannot say that coming from the west.

## The Going Abroad Scenario

This is the thought process of a young student looking to go abroad without really thinking it through, simply because everyone else is doing the same. Here's a grade 12g student from Nepal who wants to leave just because everyone else is.

__Step 1: Contemplation (Thinking):__<br>
_"Look how clean those streets are."_<br>
_"Everyone abroad looks so successful."_<br>
_"No load shedding, no bandhs." (power cuts, strikes)_<br>

__Step 2: Attachment (Wanting):__<br>
_"That could be me."_<br>
_"I want that life."_<br>
_"I'm wasting my potential here."_<br>

__Step 3: Desire (Craving):__<br>
_"I NEED to get out of Nepal."_<br>
_"All my friends are planning to go abroad."_<br>
_"I can't be left behind."_<br>

__Step 4: Anger (Frustration):__<br>
_"Why was I born in this stupid country?"_<br>
_"The government is so corrupt, there's no future here."_<br>
_"People who stay in Nepal are just settling for less."_<br>

__Step 5: Delusion (Excuses):__<br>
_"I'll figure out what I want to do once I get there."_<br>
_"Even if I'm washing dishes, I'll be earning in dollars."_<br>
_"I'll get respect in society once I'm settled abroad."_<br>

__Step 6: Lost Judgment:__<br>
_"Computer Science in Canada, Business in Australia, whatever gets me out faster."_<br>
_"Who cares about my interests, I just need to go abroad."_<br>
_"Everyone else is doing it, so it must be right."_<br>

## Krishna's Alternative Path:

__Step 1: Conscious Contemplation (Clear Seeing):__<br>
_"What are the real challenges people face there?"_<br>
_"What are my actual strengths and interests?"_<br>
_"What opportunities exist in Nepal that I haven't explored?"_<br>

__Step 2: Self-Inquiry (Questioning):__<br>
_"Am I drawn to going abroad because of genuine career goals, or just social pressure?"_<br>
_"Do I even know what I want to do with my life?"_<br>
_"Why am I in such a hurry to decide?"_<br>

__Step 3: Investigation (Research):__<br>
_"Let me talk to people who've actually studied abroad about both the good and difficult parts."_<br>
_"Let me research the job market in my field of interest, both in Nepal and abroad."_<br>
_"What happens if I don't succeed abroad? Do I have a backup plan?"_<br>

__Step 4: Svadharma (Your True Path):__<br>
_"What am I naturally talented at?"_<br>
_"What would I choose if there was no social media to influence me?"_<br>
_"What if my purpose is to contribute to Nepal's development?"_<br>

__Step 5: Detached Choice (Wise Decision):__<br>
_"I will choose my path based on what's right for me, not what will get approval from others."_<br>
_"Success is doing meaningful work that aligns with my nature, whether that's in Nepal or abroad."_<br>
_"My happiness doesn't depend on external validation."_<br>

__Step 6: Inner Wisdom (Gut Check):__<br>
_"If I remove all external pressure, what do I actually want?"_<br>
_"What would make me proud of myself in 10 years?"_<br>
_"What would I choose if I couldn't tell anyone about my decision?"_<br>

_Krishna_ shows us that when we focus too much on attractive things or trends, we start a mental process that makes us lose our ability to think clearly. The trick is to stop this process right at the start, not try to fight it at the end.

## The Joy of Walking

I think the best way to explore a city is by walking. No doubt about it.

Whenever I travel, whether it is for a conference, a meeting, or an event, I try to carve out some time just to walk. During Token 2049 in Singapore a few years back, where the schedule was packed with side events scattered across the city, I made it a point to walk from one to the other whenever I could. The city is small, and it is lovely to move through it on foot. It was not only about getting from point A to point B, but about slowing down after a long day and pausing for a moment.

I have done the same in other places too. I remember walking endlessly in Turkey, wandering through streets without any plan. In Dubai it is harder, but around Marina Bay I still try. These walks are never just about reaching somewhere.

Recently, I picked up a book called In Praise of Walking. I just wanted to learn, to see if someone had written about the benefits of walking. And of course, there are plenty. Walking feels so natural because it is. Nature gave us two legs, our default mode of transportation, and it is almost funny how often we forget that.

When I visited the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, they encouraged us to walk barefoot, to touch the earth, to be grounded. That simple act spoke to me. It reminded me that walking is more than physical exercise. It is connection. To nature, to the city, to ourselves.

Walking has so many gifts, but above all, it sparks joy. And if you work in tech or spend most of your day on screens, I encourage you to skip that taxi or scooter at least once and walk to a destination if it is less than an hour away. It is a simple way to let your senses reconnect with the world around you.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="margin: 12px auto;"><img src="/img/singapore-walking.jpg"></div>

## The Pain of Not Doing

I like to work with people who are _intensely passionate_ about what they do. It does not matter what the field is. It could be nurturing kids, reading, writing poems, solving scientific problems, or coding a simple database service. What matters is the feeling inside, whether it is fire or love that comes from the heart. It is hard to reason and explain, but it can be understood from the depth of the inner being. It is the kind of passion that makes you forget food, water, and time.

Some people call them nerds, geeks, psycho or even cracked, but I see that as a badge of honor. To be so consumed that everything else fades away is a special feeling. And these passions do not have to be about changing the world in the Silicon Valley way of thinking. They simply bring joy and happiness to the person, something they would probably do even without money. Again, it is hard to put into words in a capitalistic world where everything seems to revolve around survival and livelihood.

I once met a man in his 60s who has spent four decades crafting wooden statues. His old home in the old square has become a living museum of sculptures and artwork. He studies scriptures, commissions manuscripts, and gathers artists to bring statues to life over months or even years. He is not wealthy, but he has given much of himself to this craft. Watching him, you realize passion can turn a lifetime into a single long project, and it makes you feel that everyone should strive for such deep longing in their own way.

Another was a painter who creates only a few traditional works a year. He spends weeks in his room working on his art. He says that he does not only do it for the money, because he sometimes gives a piece away for free. For him the act of painting itself is a blessing, and he feels grateful for what he has been doing all his life. There is something humbling about that.

I see the same spark in a colleague who makes digital games with interesting ideas. He follows an idea late into the night, not because he has to, but because he cannot let it go. I also have a friend who climbs rocks wherever he travels, always searching for a wall of stone. These may seem different, but in their eyes you see the same passion. It makes me think that passion leaves a mark in any field.

What ties all of these people together is not the craft itself, but the passion behind it. To reach that level, you need to pour yourself into the work until not doing it hurts. That is the _true pain of not doing_, and it is where the true self shines.

## Vajrapani The Senior Engineer

I came across a story in Buddhist literature that has been on my mind ever since. _Vajrapani_, known for raw power, went to _Buddha_ (the enlightened being) and asked for wisdom. _Vajrapani_ already had the strength to get things done by sheer force and power, but he wanted to know what makes effort truly meaningful.

It reminded me of engineers I know who can go deep into the codebase, fix tricky bugs, and ship features, but often only see their piece of the puzzle. What they miss is how it connects with everything else , marketing trying to explain the product, customer service handling frustrated users, finance keeping the lights on, or founders shifting direction after talking to customers and the changing dynamics of the market.

I remember one sprint retro where the team had spent two weeks refactoring part of the system. The code was clean, tests were written correctly, and everyone was proud. But while that was happening, users were still stuck on a broken checkout flow. Customer service was flooded with complaints that kept piling up, and sales had no answer when people asked what was going on. The team had done good engineering work, but in the bigger picture the company had missed the mark of actually helping customers, not just doing engineering. I have seen this happen many times in my own projects.

That was _Vajrapani’s_ realization too. _Buddha’s_ response, later called the _Prajnaparamita teachings_, was simple: __nothing stands on its own. Everything depends on something else.__ You can think of it like a distributed system. Your app does not just run on the code you write, it depends on servers, networks, users, electricity, and the frameworks built by people you will never meet. Change one piece and the whole thing shifts.

For _Vajrapani_ this was not just theory or philosophy, and because he was the embodiment of raw power and action he needed more than words alone. It gave him a different way to act, not by simply adding more force but by stepping back to see how his actions affected the larger system and where his effort would truly make a difference. Instead of pushing harder in one direction, he learned to see how the parts fit together. His strength was still there, but now it worked with the whole picture rather than against it.

And maybe that is what we miss sometimes. We have endless tools, frameworks, and the ability to build almost anything, but without wisdom it feels like we are running after nothing. More code, more features, more load, but not always more clarity.

Force can move mountains, but wisdom decides which mountain is worth moving.

## Writing more or less

My virtual mentors for writing are [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/). These two incredible human beings have a completely different writing styles. Tim writes long articles narrating as the first person and every nooks and corner of the subject. Derek writes short, crisp and valuable life lessons. My favorites are [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html), [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), [this](https://sivers.org/hellyeah) and [this](https://sivers.org/evers).

Inspired by them, I tried writing a couple of drafts for #abakgarne. But it turned out horrible and, most importantly, didn’t capture my intention nor thought. It felt forced, and I had to scratch my head to write them.

As I go through my journey, I want to make the process fun for me and for everyone. I constantly ask myself what this publication should represent. The short answer is that I still don’t know. But, I’m sure that we are going to find out.

I want to make the journey fun and enlightening. And if there is a way you want to be part of this, [please say hi](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@prashishh%20Hello%20...)! I’m always looking to meet people to listen to their crazy ideas.
