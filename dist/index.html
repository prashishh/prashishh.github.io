				<a href="/ai-and-creative-workflow/">AI and Creative Workflow</a> . In 2015, I came across Tim Urban’s fascinating post about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and ASI (Artificial Superintelligence). It was an interesting read, but it was not an &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment for me at the time. My exposure to AI (or machine learning back then) was mostly through its use in engineering systems such as fraud detection, recommendation engines, and pattern recognition tools in our payment infrastructure. It felt more like solving backend challenges than experiencing anything magical.

				<a href="/on-integrity/">Integrity</a> . Handshake deals are the best kind of business deals. People come together, discuss their ideas and shake on it. No legal paperwork, just trust and the promise of work.
Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.
Having the right ingredients of integrity will set the foundation for handshake deals. Being honest to yourself &amp; others is the key to building long-term partnerships, and to creating something valuable together. Because it is impossible to start a business with someone who doesn’t pass your trust threshold.

				<a href="/writing-less-more/">Writing more or less</a> . My virtual mentors for writing are Tim Urban and Derek Sivers. These two incredible human beings have a completely different writing styles. Tim writes long articles narrating as the first person and every nooks and corner of the subject. Derek writes short, crisp and valuable life lessons. My favorites are this, this, this and this.
Inspired by them, I tried writing a couple of drafts for #abakgarne. But it turned out horrible and, most importantly, didn’t capture my intention nor thought. It felt forced, and I had to scratch my head to write them.

				<a href="/on-finding-inspiration/">On Inspiration</a> . People have asked me a countless number of times why I moved back. I have been pondering over this for some time. For the last few weeks, I have been looking for my “inspiration”.
We find inspiration in unknown places. Places which, by nature, engulf your existence and take you to a land of discovery. The discovery isn’t through the act of finding the meaning though, but by traveling through the journey. The journey might not have checkpoints nor cheerleaders, but characters who went through their paths to connect the dots going backward. Last few weeks, these characters have been my imaginary friends from books on history and biography.

				<a href="/fat-wallets/">Fat wallets</a> . I paid all my orders in cash because my previous debit card was not active. But most stores didn’t accept cards anyways. This has remained the same for a long time. I hardly noticed any store with a card reader, unlike the stores in California.
Things are changing though. The government is pushing for digital &amp; cashless payment. And e-wallets are popping up everywhere. I even gave a crash course to my dad on e-wallets.
