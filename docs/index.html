				<a href="/rachanaharu/">रचनाहरु (Rachanaharu)</a> . Yesterday, Princi and I launched a curated list of Nepali local brands and products. We called it रचनाहरु, which means creations in Nepali. (रचना means creation, adding हरु makes it plural) [The credit for the name goes to Princi.]
It makes me happy to see the recent boom in micro-entrepreneurs in Nepal. Nepali products have set a decent footprint in the market along with the international brands. I&rsquo;m not against the foreign brands, but the fact that people are taking risks to start ventures from this small Himalayan country makes me proud [David Vs Goliath].

				<a href="/on-integrity/">Integrity</a> . Handshake deals are the best kind of business deals. People come together, discuss their ideas and shake on it. No legal paperwork, just trust and the promise of work.
Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.
Having the right ingredients of integrity will set the foundation for handshake deals. Being honest to yourself &amp; others is the key to building long-term partnerships, and to creating something valuable together.

				<a href="/writing-less-more/">Writing more or less</a> . My virtual mentors for writing are Tim Urban and Derek Sivers. These two incredible human beings have a completely different writing styles. Tim writes long articles narrating as the first person and every nooks and corner of the subject. Derek writes short, crisp and valuable life lessons. My favorites are this, this, this and this.
Inspired by them, I tried writing a couple of drafts for #abakgarne. But it turned out horrible and, most importantly, didn’t capture my intention nor thought.

				<a href="/fat-wallets/">Fat wallets</a> . I paid all my orders in cash because my previous debit card was not active. But most stores didn’t accept cards anyways. This has remained the same for a long time. I hardly noticed any store with a card reader, unlike the stores in California.
Things are changing though. The government is pushing for digital &amp; cashless payment. And e-wallets are popping up everywhere. I even gave a crash course to my dad on e-wallets.

				<a href="/on-finding-inspiration/">On Inspiration</a> . People have asked me a countless number of times why I moved back. I have been pondering over this for some time. For the last few weeks, I have been looking for my “inspiration”.
We find inspiration in unknown places. Places which, by nature, engulf your existence and take you to a land of discovery. The discovery isn’t through the act of finding the meaning though, but by traveling through the journey.
